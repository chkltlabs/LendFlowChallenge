## LendFlow Code Challenge

Hey there! Thanks for considering me for this position.

As requested, the application includes a single route which passes the four
specified query parameters to the NYT Api, after FormRequest validation.

To test, simply run `php artisan test`. NYT Api routes will be faked during the tests.

Please email me with any questions at [erikgratz110@gmail.com](mailto:erikgratz110@gmail.com)
